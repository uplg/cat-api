# Home Monitor

A full-stack application for monitoring and controlling Tuya-based smart cat devices locally. 

Built with **Elysia** (backend) and **React** (frontend), it provides comprehensive device management for smart feeders, fountains, and automatic litter boxes.

Also handles Hue lamps using BLE.

Concept: A custom "home assistant" without the overhead.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (latest version)
- [Docker](https://docker.com) & Docker Compose (for production deployment)
- One or more Tuya-compatible smart cat devices (feeders, fountains, litter boxes) and/or Hue lamps.
- Device credentials (ID, Key, IP) for each device

## Installation

### Development Setup

1. **Getting Device Credentials**

   To retrieve device credentials, you need a Tuya Cloud account (free):

   1. Create an account at https://iot.tuya.com
   2. Create a project and select the correct datacenter
   3. Add your devices (easiest way: scan QR code with Smart Life app)
   4. Use API Explorer > Device Management > Query device details
   5. Get the device ID from the devices list and retrieve the local key

   **Note**: The local key changes when the device is reset or removed from Smart Life.

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uplg/home-monitor.git
   cd home-monitor
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   bun install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend && bun install && cd ..
   ```

4. **Device Configuration**

   Create a `devices.json` file in the root directory with your device configurations:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "name": "Pixi Smart Feeder",
       "id": "your_feeder_device_id",
       "key": "your_feeder_device_key",
       "category": "cwwsq",
       "product_name": "Pixi Smart Feeder",
       "ip": "192.168.1.174",
       "version": "3.4"
     },
     {
       "name": "Cat Litter Box",
       "id": "your_litter_device_id",
       "key": "your_litter_device_key",
       "category": "msp",
       "product_name": "Cat Litter Box",
       "ip": "192.168.1.145",
       "version": "3.5"
     },
     {
      "name": "Pixi Smart Fountain",
      "id": "your_fountain_device_id",
      "key": "your_fountain_device_key",
      "category": "cwysj",
      "product_name": "Pixi Smart Fountain",
      "ip": "192.168.1.44",
      "version": "3.3"
     }
   ]
   ```

   **Device Configuration Fields:**

   - `name`: Friendly name for your device
   - `id`: Tuya device ID
   - `key`: Tuya device local key
   - `category`: Device category (cwwsq for feeders, msp for litter boxes)
   - `product_name`: Product name from Tuya
   - `ip`: Local IP address of the device
   - `version`: Tuya protocol version (usually 3.4 or 3.5)

5. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Configure your `.env` file:

   ```env
   # API Server port
   PORT=3033

   # JWT Secret for authentication (generate a secure random string using `openssl rand -hex 16`)
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-me
   ```

6. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   # Start both backend and frontend in development mode
   bun run dev
   ```

   Or start them separately:

   ```bash
   # Backend only (port 3033)
   bun run dev:backend

   # Frontend only (port 5173)
   bun run dev:frontend
   ```

   - **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3033`
   - **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173`
   - **OpenAPI Docs**: `http://localhost:3033/openapi`

## Deployment

### Docker Mode (without Bluetooth)

Run everything in Docker. Hue Bluetooth lamps are disabled in this mode.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build   # Start
docker-compose down            # Stop
```

The app is available at `http://localhost` (port 80).

### Hybrid Mode (with Bluetooth)

To use Philips Hue Bluetooth lamps, run the backend locally (for Bluetooth access) and only the frontend in Docker.

```bash
make hybrid   # Starts local backend + Docker frontend
```

| Mode | Tuya Devices | Hue Lamps | Command |
|------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Docker | ✅ | ❌ | `docker-compose up -d` |
| Hybrid | ✅ | ✅ | `make hybrid` |
| Local dev | ✅ | ✅ | `bun run dev` |

### Makefile Commands

```bash
make help           # Show all commands
make hybrid         # Start hybrid mode
make backend-local  # Start backend only (background)
make backend-stop   # Stop local backend
make docker-up      # Start Docker mode
make docker-down    # Stop Docker
make clean          # Stop everything
```

### Configuration

- Set `API_PORT` in `.env` to change the backend port (default: 3033)
- `devices.json` - Device configurations
- `devices-cache.json` - Cache for DPS that are not readable (only usable after a modification / event received)
- `users.json` - Users credentials (copy from `users.json.template`)
- `hue-lamps.json` - Hue lamps identifier if connected
- `hue-lamps-blacklist.json` - Blacklist to handle Hue lamps that don't belong to you (not connected once)

## API Documentation

### OpenAPI

Interactive API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3033/openapi`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Device Connection Failed**

   - Verify device IP address and network connectivity
   - Check if device is powered on and connected to WiFi
   - Retry the request, Tuya devices don't support multi devices connected at the same time (it might be your phone as an example), else it's probably a wrong protocol version (3.3 instead of 3.4 as an example)

2. **ECONNRESET**

   - Double-check `id` and `key` in device.json
   - Verify device version (usually 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5 for recent tuya devices)

3. **Meal Plan Not Reading**

   - The device may not have a meal plan retrieved yet, DPS don't expose the raw data so we need to update (and then it's saved on instance)
   - Try setting a meal plan first using the POST endpoint

4. **DPS Scan Taking Too Long**
   - Use smaller ranges: `?start=1&end=50` instead of full scan
   - Reduce timeout: `?timeout=1000` for faster scanning
   - Target known DPS ranges for your device type

### Debug Mode

The API includes comprehensive logging. Check the console output for:

- Device connection status
- DPS scan results
- Meal plan encoding/decoding details
- Real-time event reports
